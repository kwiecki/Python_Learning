## Mini-Project: Scalable Data Pipeline

For the final project, you'll build a complete, scalable data pipeline that integrates multiple advanced concepts:

1. Collect data from a web API or through web scraping
2. Process the data using parallel techniques for performance
3. Apply machine learning for data enrichment or analysis
4. Store the processed data in cloud storage
5. Containerize the application with Docker
6. Orchestrate the workflow with a scheduling tool
7. Implement monitoring and error handling

This project will demonstrate how to combine multiple advanced techniques to create a robust, production-ready data pipeline.

## Learning Approach

Work through the topics based on your specific needs and interests:

1. Start with concurrency and parallelism to improve performance
2. Add machine learning or NLP if you need predictive or text analysis
3. Learn web scraping if you need to gather data from websites
4. Study ETL development for structured data processing
5. Explore cloud integration for scalability
6. Add containerization for deployment consistency
7. Implement workflow orchestration for complex pipelines

Given your background in data governance and quality management, consider focusing initially on ETL pipeline development, containerization, and workflow orchestration, as these complement data governance practices with technical implementation.
