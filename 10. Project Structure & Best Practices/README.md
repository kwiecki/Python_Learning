## Project Organization

A well-structured Python project makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain your code.

**Key concepts:**
- Directory structures for different project types
- Separating source code, tests, and documentation
- Module organization and imports
- Configuration management
- Managing shared resources
- Organizing data files and assets
- Separating concerns (code vs. configuration)

**Standard project structure:**
```

- Writing clear function and class docstrings
- Markdown and reStructuredText formats
- Documentation tools (Sphinx, MkDocs)
- Generating API documentation
- Integrating documentation into development
- Documentation best practices

**Docstring formats:**
```python
# Google Style
def calculate_metric(data, metric_type="mean"):
    """Calculate specified metric for the given data.
    
    Args:
        data (list): Input data to calculate metrics on.
        metric_type (str, optional): Type of metric to calculate.
            Supported values: 'mean', 'median', 'std'. Defaults to "mean".
            
    Returns:
        float: The calculated metric value.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported metric type is provided.
        TypeError: If data is not a list of numbers.
    
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_metric([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "mean")
        3.0
    """
